# d2d-simple

This is a basic Direct2D sample application as provided on Microsoft's documentation site in the article _Creating a simple Direct2D application_:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct2d/direct2d-quickstart

I made one minor adaptation to the original code presented in the article, which was to remove a reference to a WIN32 API call related to desktop DPI which is flagged by VS 2019 as being deprecated.
